### Hi there, I'm Ben Faerber 🦀🐪 ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=benfaerber)

📒 [My Portfolio](https://benfaerber.github.io)

✍️ I love making things, especially software because I can create anything I want out of nothing. Most people think of programming as a heavily left brained activity but I view it as a skill that requires immense creativity.

💻 I'm from Salt Lake City, Utah and am currently working at True Leaf Market creating shipping software. In my spare time I work with Rust, OCaml, and Typescript. I am interested in programming language design and lexical analysis!

😁 If you are using any of my projects and are having bugs or need a new feature, please reach out and I will do my best to help you!
