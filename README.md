I used to be quite involved in the [Rescript](https://rescript-lang.org/) Community. A typesafe language based on OCaml's type system that compiles to Javascript.
I even contributed to [Rescript React](https://github.com/rescript-lang/rescript-react)!

✍️ I love making things, especially software because I can create anything I want out of nothing. Most people think of programming as a heavily left brained activity but I view it as a skill that requires immense creativity.

💻 I'm from Salt Lake City, Utah and am currently working at True Leaf Market creating shipping software. In my spare time I work with Rust, OCaml, and Typescript. I am interested in programming language design and lexical analysis!
