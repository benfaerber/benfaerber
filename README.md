### Hi there, I'm Ben Faerber 👋

📒 [My Portfolio](https://benfaerber.github.io)

✍️ I love making things, especially software because I can create anything I want out of nothing. Most people think of programming as a heavily left brained activity but I view it as a skill that requires immense creativity.

💻 I'm from Salt Lake City, Utah and am currently working at True Leaf Market as a software developer. I am currently working on implementing custom shipping software  that performs rate calculations, determines the best shipping provider for orders and estimates shipping speed. I am also desgining an ecommerce platform!

😁 If you are using any of my projects and are having bugs or need a new feature, please reach out and I will do my best to help you!
