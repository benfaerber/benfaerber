### Hi there, I'm Ben Faerber 👋

✍️ I love making things, especially software because I can create anything I want out of nothing. Most people think of programming as a heavily left brained activity but I view it as a skill that requires immense creativity.

💻 I'm from Salt Lake City, Utah and am trying to get started in the tech field here in the Silcon Slopes. I'm currently developing the app Sardines which calculates the population of public places to give users accurate data about how busy public locations are.

😁 If you are using any of my projects and are having bugs or need a new feature, please reach out and I will do my best to help you!
